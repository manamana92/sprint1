Ideas:
	Hex Converter
        use var = getchar() inside while loop and reallocate
            string variable and append to end.
	
	AES Encryption tool?
	    
Stories:
	As a user, I should be able to make UI Cipher Selctions and entries
	, input plaintext, and recieve cyphertext.

	As a user I should be able to select the Chaining mode.

	As a user I should be able to provide a 128 bit key (in hex string),
	and have the program successfully perform a key expansion for use in
	the AES algorithm

Tasks:
	Build an AES engine
		Subtasks:
			Complete Key Expansion
			Complete the Cipher Algorithm
	Build the AES cipher and engine with ability
		to expand size of key
	Build the UI and sanitize user entry
