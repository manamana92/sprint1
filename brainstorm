Reqs:
	Recieves Input
	Modifies the input
	Outputs the modified input

Ideas:
	Hex Converter
        use var = getchar() inside while loop and reallocate
            string variable and append to end.
	
	AES Encryption tool?
	    
Stories:
	As a user, I should be able to make UI Cipher Selctions and entries, input plaintext, and recieve cyphertext.

	(REMOVED) As a user I should be able to select the Chaining mode.

	(REMOVED) As a user I should be able to provide a 128 bit key (in hex string), and have the program successfully perform a key expansion for use in the AES algorithm

    As a user, I should be able to select AES key size and have the keyExpansion successfully compute a key schedule for use in the cipher.

    As a user I should be able to enter a message and be returned an encrypted version of the message.

    As a user I should be able to decrypt the same message and print the result.

Tasks:
	Build an AES engine
		Subtasks:
			Complete Key Expansion
			Complete the Cipher Algorithm
	Build the AES cipher and engine with ability
		to expand size of key
	Build the UI and sanitize user entry
